                <h2>Understanding Mid-Market Exchange Rates</h2>
                <p>
                    The mid-market rate (also called the interbank rate or mid-point rate) is the midpoint between the buy and sell prices of two currencies on the global market. This is the "true" exchange rate you see on Google or financial news sites—it's the rate banks and currency services use to trade with each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Why use mid-market rates?</strong> Most currency exchange services add a markup to the mid-market rate to make a profit. By showing you the mid-market rate, you can see the true value of your money and compare it to what exchange services are offering. This transparency helps you avoid hidden fees and get the best deal possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our currency converter updates exchange rates daily from reliable financial data sources, ensuring you always see accurate, real-time information for your currency conversions.
                </p>

                    <h3>What is the mid-market exchange rate?</h3>
                    <p>The mid-market rate is the midpoint between the buy and sell prices of two currencies. It's the "real" exchange rate without any markup. Banks and currency services use this rate when trading with each other, but typically add a margin when dealing with customers.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Why is my bank's exchange rate different?</h3>
                    <p>Banks and currency exchange services typically add a markup to the mid-market rate—this is how they make money on currency conversions. Their rates may be 2-5% (or more) worse than the mid-market rate shown on our converter.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I use this for business transactions?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, our currency converter is suitable for estimating business transaction values. However, for actual business payments, use your bank or payment provider's rate, as it may differ from the mid-market rate.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Which currencies are supported?</h3>

                    <h3>How do I convert USD to EUR?</h3>
                    <p>Select USD in the first dropdown menu, enter your amount, and select EUR in the second dropdown. The conversion will happen automatically showing you how many euros you'll get for your dollars.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What does the swap button do?</h3>
                    <p>The swap button (↕) reverses your currency selection. If you're converting USD to EUR, clicking swap will change it to EUR to USD, making it easy to see the conversion in both directions.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I know if I'm getting a good exchange rate?</h3>
                    <p>Compare the rate offered by your bank or exchange service to our mid-market rate. The closer to the mid-market rate, the better the deal. Watch out for rates that are 3-5% or more below the mid-market rate.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is the best time to exchange currency?</h3>
                    <p>Exchange rates fluctuate throughout the day based on market conditions. For large amounts, consider monitoring rates over several days. For typical transactions, the difference day-to-day is usually minimal.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I use this converter offline?</h3>
                    <p>No, the converter requires an internet connection to fetch the latest exchange rates. However, you can note the exchange rate and use it for manual calculations offline.</p>

                    <h3>How does currency conversion work?</h3>
                    <p>Currency conversion multiplies your amount by the exchange rate. For example: 1,000 USD × 0.92 (rate) = 920 EUR. The exchange rate represents how much of the target currency equals one unit of your source currency.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Are there any limits on conversion amounts?</h3>
                    <p>No, you can convert any amount. However, keep in mind this is for informational purposes—actual conversion limits depend on your bank or exchange service.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Why do I see decimal places in my conversion?</h3>
                    <p>Currencies are typically expressed to 2 decimal places (cents), but exchange rates can have 4-6 decimal places for precision. This ensures accurate calculations especially for large amounts.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What's the difference between buying and selling rates?</h3>
                    <p>The buying rate is what you pay when purchasing a currency; the selling rate is what you receive when selling. The mid-market rate we show is the middle point. Banks typically offer worse buying rates and better selling rates (from their perspective).</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I trust this currency converter for travel planning?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, our converter is excellent for travel planning and budgeting. It helps you estimate costs in your home currency. Just remember that airports and exchange booths typically offer rates 5-10% worse than the mid-market rate.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do exchange rates affect international shopping?</h3>
                    <p>When shopping internationally online, your credit card company will convert the price using their exchange rate (usually close to mid-market) plus a foreign transaction fee (typically 1-3%). Use our converter to estimate the final cost in your currency.</p>
